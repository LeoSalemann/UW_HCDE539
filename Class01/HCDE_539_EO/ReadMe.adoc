= Arduino-Driven LED Traffic Light

Leo J.Salemann, leow@uw.edu

Designed and simulated with https://www.tinkercad.com[Autodesk(R) Tinkercad(TM)]

Deployed to Adafruit Metro with https://create.arduino.cc[Ardino Web Editor]

Posted to https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/projects/9cd996[Arduino Project Hub]

Submitted for Exercise 0, HCDE 539 Physical Computing, University of Washington

October 7, 2018

== Step 1: Installation

a. Open Tinkercad circuit project https://www.tinkercad.com/things/bmWjk7KrzkS-arduino-led-traffic-light-modular-code[Arduino LED Traffic Light - Modular Code]
b. Download the code from Tinkercad, upload to your Arduino IDE (desktop or cloud versions should both work).

== Step 2: Assemble the circuit

a. Wire up the Arduino Uno (or Adafruit metro), LED's, resistors, and breadboard as shown in the tinkercad drawing.
b. Also see LeosTinkerCAD_RevC.PNG, included with this sketch.

== Step 3: Load the code

From your Arduino IDE, verifiy the code then upload it to your board.

/*
 * In TinkerCad, the pins are 0, 1, 2 but that causes an error:
 *   avrdude stk500_getsync() not in sync resp=0x30
 * After much googling, I found a solution that suggested to avoid using pin 0
 *   https://www.instructables.com/id/A-solution-to-avrdude-stk500getsync-not-in-syn/
 * Actually, my professor advised starting at pin 2.
