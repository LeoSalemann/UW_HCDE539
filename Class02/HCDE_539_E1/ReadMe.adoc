= Individual Builds (Sensors, Motors, Wildcard)

Leo J.Salemann, leow@uw.edu

Designed and simulated with https://www.tinkercad.com[Autodesk(R) Tinkercad(TM)]

Deployed to Adafruit Metro with https://create.arduino.cc[Ardino Web Editor]

Posted to https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/projects/9cd996[Arduino Project Hub]

Submitted for Exercise 1, HCDE 539 Physical Computing, University of Washington

October 15, 2018

= Overview
For the initial design and implementation, I created a "Sensor Smorgasbord" project in which I combined all four individual builds onto one bread board, and wrote a single program to run everything. The project was "born in the cloud" using TinkerCad and the Arduino Web Editor. I then reimplmented the Smorgasboard in Fritzing, then made copies to reduce it down to Light sensor only, Magnetic Sensor only, etc.

= Light Sensor
The light sensor is implemented according to the adaffruit description at https://www.adafruit.com/product/161. One pin is connected to 5V; the other is connected to Arduino Analog pin A0 as well as a grounded 220 ohm resistor. The code initializes the pin as input, reads it, and prints a value to the serial monitor. Values range from 22 in a dark room, 735 under regular room lighting, and 1017  when illuminted by an iPhone "flashlight" at point-blank range.

Didn't get good readings withe the recommended 10 kOhm resistor; worked much better with 220 Ohms.

= Magnetic Sensor
Per class instructions, used a temperature sensor for schematics. Relied on https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/US5881_rev007.pdf[Melexis data sheet] from https://www.adafruit.com/product/158[adafruit product page] for actual pin out and magnetic properties.

Took awhile get the reading to respond to the rare earth magnet.  This time, I elminated the resistor completely. Also found that the hall effect only responds to one pole (South I believe) from the magnet.  Found this out empirically by waving the magnet and watching the serial monitor.  Looking back at the data sheet, it's badically what they predicted.

= Motor
A quick look at the datashet for the https://www.adafruit.com/product/169[servo], suggested it's more for digital rather than analog interfacing.  From what little I know about servos, their motion is limited, in contrast to a free spinning motor.  So for this one, I skipped the servo and used the https://www.adafruit.com/product/1201[vibrating mini motor disc] instead.

== Problems, Successes Learnings
The challenge with this one was getting those thin wires to stay in the breadboard. Ended up cutting a couple https://www.adafruit.com/product/153[jumper wires] in half, stripping the cut ends, and twisting them onto the motor leads.

= Wildcard (Potentiometer)
For my wild card, I chose the https://www.adafruit.com/product/356potentiometer], using the wiring suggested an https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-lesson-8-analog-inputs/an-experiment[adafruit experiment]

This one went pretty smoothly, once I found the breadboard experiment.
