= Individual Builds (Sensors, Motors, Wildcard)

Leo J.Salemann, leow@uw.edu

Designed and simulated with https://www.tinkercad.com[Autodesk(R) Tinkercad(TM)]

Deployed to Adafruit Metro with https://create.arduino.cc[Ardino Web Editor]

Posted to https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/projects/9cd996[Arduino Project Hub]

Submitted for Exercise 1, HCDE 539 Physical Computing, University of Washington

= Overview
For the initial design and implementation, I created a "Sensor Smorgasbord" project in which I combined all four individual builds onto one bread board, and wrote a single program to run everything. The project was "born in the cloud" using TinkerCad and the Arduino Web Editor. I then reimplmented the Smorgasboard in Fritzing, then made copies to reduce it down to Light sensor only, Magnetic Sensor only, etc.

= Light Sensor
The light sensor is implemented according to the adaffruit description at https://www.adafruit.com/product/161. One pin is connected to 5V; the other is connected to Arduino Analog pin A0 as well as a grounded 220 ohm resistor. The code initializes the pin as input, reads it, and prints a value to the serial monitor. Values range from 22 in a dark room, 735 under regular room lighting, and 1017  when illuminted by an iPhone "flashlight" at point-blank range.
