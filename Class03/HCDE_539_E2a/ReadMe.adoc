== Overview

Good thing I picked a potentiometer for the "Wildcard" part of Assingment E1.  I was able to use it as-is, just adding the LED/resistor  subassembly to it.  First time I ran across Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) was while mentoring a FIRST Robotics team (FRC 1983 Sunk Works Robotics). It was tricky stuff back then, but I'm pleased to see it's simply a matter of chossing the right digital ouptut pin here.  Thanks, Arduino!  Finally, I made use of the map() function to convert the potiometer's 1024-step range to the PWM/LED's 256-step.

== Serial Monitor Output

In order to get a good serital monitor output, I had to introduce a 500ms delay, to prevent the text from streaming past the screen too fast.  Problem is, it also slows down the LED response.  So I comment out the delay when demonstrating the LED; and put it bac in for serial monotoring.

Here's a screenshot with the daly in place ..

... and if you go back to the video, you can see the monotor at max speed with no delay.

== Problems, Sucesses, Learnings
I still have both sub-assingments on one board, but this time the code is separate. Choosing the potentiometer as my wildcard project last week was a lucky break; as well as getting introducted to the map() function early in the class.
