== Overview

Good thing I picked a potentiometer for the "Wildcard" part of Assingment E1.  I was able to use it as-is, just adding the LED part to it.  First time I ran across Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) was while mentoring a FIRST Robotics team (FRC 1983 Sunk Works Robotics). It was tricky stuff back then, but I'm pleased to see it's simply a matter of chossing the right digital ouptut pin here.  Thanks, Arduino!
