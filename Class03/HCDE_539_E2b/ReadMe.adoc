== Overview

In this implementation, the doorbell acts like an old-timey buzzer. A tone starts when the button is pushed and stops when the button is released.

  State change detection (edge detection)

  Often, you don't need to know the state of a
  digital input all the time,  but you just need
  to know when the input changes from one state to
  another.  For example, you want to know when a
  button goes from OFF to ON.  This is called
  state change detection, or edge detection.

  This example shows how to detect when a button
  or button changes from off to on  and on to off.


  The circuit:
  * pushbutton attached to pin 2 from +5V
  * 10K resistor attached to pin 2 from ground
  * LED attached from pin 13 to ground (or use the
  built-in LED on  most Arduino boards)

  This example code is in the public domain.

    firstTime = false;
    
    // if the state has changed, increment the counter
    if (buttonState == HIGH) {
      // if the current state is HIGH, then the button
      // went from off to on
      buttonPushCounter += 1;
      Serial.println("on");
      Serial.print("number of button pushes: ");
