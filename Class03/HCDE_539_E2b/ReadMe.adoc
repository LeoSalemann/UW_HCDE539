== Overview

In this implementation, the doorbell acts like an old-timey buzzer. A tone starts when the button is pushed and stops when the button is released.  I based my circuit and code off of the https://www.tinkercad.com/things/iuQmPwCoU9x[tikercad.com state change detection sample]. A curious side effect or the sample, is that it uses a pull-down resistor arrangment instead of pull-up.

  State change detection (edge detection)

  Often, you don't need to know the state of a
  digital input all the time,  but you just need
  to know when the input changes from one state to
  another.  For example, you want to know when a
  button goes from OFF to ON.  This is called
  state change detection, or edge detection.

  This example shows how to detect when a button
  or button changes from off to on  and on to off.


  The circuit:
  * pushbutton attached to pin 2 from +5V
  * 10K resistor attached to pin 2 from ground
  * LED attached from pin 13 to ground (or use the
  built-in LED on  most Arduino boards)

  This example code is in the public domain.

  // compare the buttonState to its previous state
  if (buttonState != lastButtonState) {
    firstTime = false;
    
    // if the state has changed, increment the counter
    if (buttonState == HIGH) {
      // if the current state is HIGH, then the button
      // went from off to on
      buttonPushCounter += 1;
      Serial.println("on");
      Serial.print("number of button pushes: ");
      Serial.println(buttonPushCounter);
      tone(pinBuzzer, 400);
    } else {
      // if the current state is LOW, then the button
      // went from on to off

    // delay a little bit to avoid debouncing
    delay(5); // Wait for 5 millisecond(s)
  }

== Problems, Sucesses, Learnings
One of the first things I did with the sample code was get rid of those dreadful hard-coded pin numbers and put in some variables like a civlized person. I fumbled around with the button/resistor/5V arrangment. I ended up with a pull-down instead of pullup resistor; but hey, it works. As I was looking around at code samples, I found some cute samples that caused the buzzer to play a little tune. That would requrie a full refactoring though, as I'd need to trigger off of a traditional click event instead of the buttown-down/button-up edge events.  Maybe next time.
