# Build Notes
- I've been using line resources, such as adafruit online code ditor and tinkercad sircuits
- Documentation is in ascii doc, printed therough asciidocLive
  - Tricky bit:  Images need to be full explicit web paths.  Since mine live on github I need to do <github path>/blob/image.jpg?raw=true
