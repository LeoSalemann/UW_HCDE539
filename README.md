# Class Work
- Homeworks in _Class01, 02, 03_
- Sketches (code & ascii doc) in _Sketches_, downloaded from https://create.arduino.cc/
- Final project in _Arduino Model Flight Simulator_, migrated from Azure DevOps
- Wiki Describning the final project at _HCDE-Final-Project-wiki/_, also migrated from Azure DevOps

# Issues Encountered
Asciidoc can be a bit jarring if you're used to markdown, particularly if you're trying to print to PDF.  The most mainless approach I've found involves the online reource [asciidocLIVE](https://asciidoclive.com).  The tricky part is that your image paths have to be full https links.  If you'r images are on github, right click each one and do a _Copy Image path_ You should get a link that looks like _https://github.com/username/reponame/**blob**/image.jpg?raw=true_

# What's Next
If I wanna get real wierd with it, I'll [Try mgreau's procedure for Converting AsciiDoc to HTML/PDF & publish to GitHub Pages with Travis CI and Asciidoctor Docker containers.](http://mgreau.com/posts/2016/03/28/asciidoc-to-gh-pages-with-travis-ci-docker-asciidoctor.html)
