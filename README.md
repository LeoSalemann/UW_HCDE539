# Issues Encountered
Asciidoc can be a bit jarring if you're used to markdown, particularly if you're trying to print to PDF.  The most mainless approach I've found involves the online reource [asciidocLIVE](https://asciidoclive.com).  The tricky part is that your image paths have to be full https links.  If you'r images are on github, right click each one and do a _Copy Image path_ You should get a link that looks like _https://github.com/username/reponame/**blob**/image.jpg?raw=true_
